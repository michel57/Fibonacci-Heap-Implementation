Fibonacci-Heap-Implementation
=============================

Fibonacci Heap implementation in C++

The Fibonacci Heap is a heap data structure consisting of a collection
of trees.

There seems to be no implementation trouble. If you found any, please
feel free to contact me w/ details.

This implementation has been tested against memory leak on a large set
of data. If you find any memory leak, please contact me with a test set.
